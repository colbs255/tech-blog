Yep, even the creator of python did not know about git worktrees.
They are not well known, but they are quite powerful.
Worktrees allow you to checkout multiple branches independently,
so you can work on a branch then seamlessly switch to another branch without clobbering the changes you have made in the current branch.
Once you learn how to use worktrees, it is hard to go back!

== What are they?

Like most git concepts, worktrees are best explained by example.
Imagine you are working on a new feature and a major production issue comes up - you need to quickly switch to a new hotfix branch, but you do not want to lose your changes.
Without git worktrees, you have 2 options:

. commit all changes to a temporary save commit
. stash all changes and then apply them later after making the hotfix

Neither of these options are ideal - you are saving changes that are not ready to be saved (including untracked files) then changing the state of your project.
You also have to wait for your IDE to re-index the project.
It's like browsing the web with only 1 tab - you always have to navigate back to what you were working on.
What you really want is a separate context that you can work on without touching the context you are currently on (a new tab).
You could do this by re-cloning the repo to a separate folder. Then your working state is preserved but that is not ideal either:

* disk space is wasted
* cloning takes time
* IDE has to index the project again
* fetch operations have to be performed separately for each repo copy

This is where git worktrees come in, they give you the benefits of having multiple copies of your repo without the disadvantages above.
Think of a worktree as a workspace in your repo.
When you create a new worktree, a folder will be created that looks like your normal repo, but you don't actually have to re-clone it.
Going back to the web browser analogy, it's like you have more than 1 tab now! You can switch to a different tab (worktree) without changing what you are looking at in the current tab.
You can check out a branch in one worktree and then checkout a different branch in another worktree.
This is what we mean when we say worktrees allow you to check out more than one branch!

== How do you use them?

Let's walk through a worktrees example.

First, create a new git repo:

[,bash]
----
mkdir test-repo
cd test-repo
git init
----

Initializing a repo like this actually also creates a worktree. You can list worktrees with:

[,bash]
----
git worktree list
----

Let's add a file to our new repo and commit it:

[,bash]
----
touch test.txt
git add .
git commit -m "first"
----

Let's create a new worktree for a hotfix:

[,bash]
----
git worktree add ../hotfix
----

This will create a new directory that looks like a normal git repo.
If we run `git worktree list` again, we will see our new worktree:

.hotfix worktree
----
> git worktree list
/var/home/colby/scratch/test-repo  2bb7aa3 [main]
/var/home/colby/scratch/hotfix     2bb7aa3 [hotfix]
----

WARNING: A branch can only be checked out in one worktree.
For example, if you check out `main` in one worktree, an error like "fatal: 'main' is already checked out at..." will occur.
You can create a new branch off of main and check it out in a new worktree though.

Let's navigate to our new worktree:

[,bash]
----
cd ../hotfix
----

You can make changes, commit, push, and even switch branches in this directory just like a normal repo!
You can also navigate back to the main repo at anytime to make independent changes.

NOTE: Take a look at the `.git` file in your worktrees. Unlike what you would find in normal repos, it is a file that links to your bare repo.

To remove a worktree, use the `worktree remove` command with the path to the worktree.

[,bash]
----
cd ../test-repo
git worktree remove ../hotfix
----

And that's all you need to know to get started with worktrees!
To summarize, these are the most common commands you will use for git worktrees:

[horizontal]
git worktree list:: list worktrees
git worktree add <worktree>:: add a worktree at the specified path
git worktree remove <worktree>:: remove a worktree, deleting the directory it is stored in

== Git worktree add variations

The `git worktree add <path>` example used above is the simplest form of the command.
It creates a new worktree at `path` and checks out the branch with that same name.
If the branch does not exist, it will create one off of the HEAD.
The command has a few more arguments that makes it more flexible though.
Here's the full version of the command:

[,bash]
----
# Arguments in [] are optional
git worktree add [-b <new-branch>] <path> [<branch>]
----

Let's break the command down:

path:: The file path your workingtree will be created in.
branch:: The branch that will be checked out in your new workingtree. If ommitted, the checked out branch will come from the path.
`-b new-branch`:: If included, a new branch will be created off of the checked out branch with this name.

We can combine these arguments for different use cases:

.Create a workingtree (feature) and checkout a branch that is different from the workingtree name (feature/create-user-interface)
[,bash]
----
git worktree add feature feature/create-user-interface
----

.Create a workingtree (feature), checkout a branch that is different from the workingtree name (develop), and create a new branch on top of that branch (feature/create-user-interface)
[,bash]
----
git worktree add feature develop -b feature/create-user-interface
----

== Best Practices

=== Use workingtrees with bare git repos

This is where we get into the more opinionated part of the article.
When going over `worktree add`, we used paths like this `../branch`.
This works but it clutters up the parent directory of your git project.
Some recommend creating a parent folder and storing all your worktrees in there like this:

[,bash]
----
mkdir ../myrepo-worktrees
git worktree add ../myrepo-worktrees/hotfix
cd ../hotfix
----

I'm not a fan of this either because you now have 2 separate folders for the same project.
I recommend cloning your project as a bare repo and then creating your worktrees inside the bare repo like this:

[,bash]
----
git clone myrepo --bare
cd myrepo
git worktree add hotfix
cd hotfix
----

Now all your work is in one directory and you do not have to use the `..`.

NOTE: Not familiar with bare git repos? See xref:bare-git-repo.adoc[]

=== Use long-lived workingtrees

I recommend having a few long-lived workingtrees:

main:: Always keep your main branch checked out here.
Allows you to quickly check the latest state of your repo.
This replaced the need for me to open the repo in my browser.
hotfix:: Create your hotfix branches in here.

When working on a new feature, create a new worktree for it and delete it when you are done with the feature.
This allows you to work on multiple features independently.

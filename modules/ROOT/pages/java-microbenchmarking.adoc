:keywords: java, performance
:revdate: July 2023

def microbenchmarking
introduce jmh

basic example (copy baeldung)

iteration: has a set time limit
    runs test as many times as it can in that time limit
    computes statistics for that iteration

can configure warmup iterations that don't count towards stats

blackhole concept

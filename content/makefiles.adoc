= Makefiles are still useful
:keywords: make, makefile, build
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

Yes, I am talking about the 1976 build tool: `make` - that thing your old professor always tried to get you to use.
Modern build tools like `maven`, `gradle`, and `bazel` have taken over, but `make` still deserves to be in your toolkit.

== Syntax?

[source,make]
----
all: build run
reveal.js:
	echo Downloading reveal.js
	git clone -b 3.9.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
	rm -rf reveal.js/.git
build: reveal.js
	asciidoctor-revealjs presentation.adoc
run:
	open presentation.html
clean:
	rm *.html
	rm -rf reveal.js
----

== Example

If you use a bunch of build scripts, consider make

== Reasons

* Basic syntax
* make is everywhere
* vim has a built in make command

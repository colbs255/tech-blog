= Makefiles are still useful
:keywords: make, makefile, build
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

Yes, I am talking about the 1976 build tool: `make` - that thing your old professor always tried to get you to use.
Modern build tools like `maven`, `gradle`, and `bazel` have taken over, but `make` still deserves to be in your toolkit.

== Syntax?

[source,make]
----
build:
	asciidoctor -D build --backend=html5 content/*.adoc
run: build
	open build/index.html
clean:
	rm -rf build

.PHONY: clean run
----

== Example

If you use a bunch of build scripts, consider a makefile!

== Reasons

* Basic syntax
* Lot of power with a few lines of code
* make is everywhere
* vim has a built in make command

= Spliterator
:keywords: java, spliterator, iterator

Like an iterator, spliterators allow you to traverse through elements of a source, but can also be split for potentially parallel algorithms.
They can easily be converted to streams via `StreamSupport#stream`, and their single iteration method: `tryAdvance` is easier to reason about than the 2 iteration methods: `next` and `hasNext` on the iterator interface.
